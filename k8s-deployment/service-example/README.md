## Objective

> Here we are trying to create multiple pods and one service. We are attaching the same label to each pod so that the pods can access the same service. After this when we will try to provide traffic to the particular service, it will distribute the traffic among the pods using the load balancing strategy. For the better understanding we have used different images in each pod, so that the output will be a prominent one.

### Commands
___

```
kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml

kubectl get ns

kubectl apply -f pod1.yaml -n svc
kubectl apply -f pod1.yaml -n svc

kubectl apply -f service.yaml -n svc

kubectl get pods -n svc --watch
kubectl get pods -w -n svc
kubectl get pods -o wide -n svc

kubectl get service -w -n svc

kubectl get all -n svc

kubectl delete pods pod1 -n svc
kubectl delete pods pod2 -n svc

kubectl delete service/myservice -n svc

kubectl delete namespace svc
```
